Linear pricing

Theorem. (Linear Pricing) Suppose there is no arbitrage. Suppose also
    * Price of cash flow cₐ is pₐ
    * Price of cash flow cₔ is pₔ
Then the price of cash flow that pays c = cₐ + cₔ must be pₐ+pₔ.

Let p denote the price of the total cash flow c. Suppose p < pₐ + pₔ, i.e. c is cheap! 
Will create an arbitrage portfolio, i.e. a free-lunch portfolio.

    * Purchase c at price P
    * Sell cash flow cₐ and cₔ separately

Price of the portfolio = p - pₐ - pₔ < 0, i.e. net income at time t=0.
The cash flows cancel out at all times. Future cash flows = zero. Free lunch!
No arbitrage ⇛ no free lunch. Therefore, p >= pₐ + pₔ

We can reverse the argument if p > pₐ+pₔ
    * Note that we need a liquid market for buying/selling all the cash flows
