Why financial markets?
------------------------------
Financial markets enable efficient allocation of resources
    * across time
    * across states of nature

Young worker with a high salary, What should she do?
    * Financial markets: invest in stocks and bonds to finnace retirement, home ownership, education, etc.
    * No financial markets: consumption? what else?

Farmer producing oranges.
    * Financial markets: Hedge using futures markets, weather related derivatives
    * No financial markets: only the spot market available


More on markets and products
------------------------------
Role of Markets
    * Gather information
    * Aggregate liquidity i.e. supply and demand
    * Promote efficiency and fairness

Products: satisfy "needs"
    * Hedge risk
    * Allow speculation
    * Raise funds
    * Fund liabilities

Modeling financial markets
------------------------------
Two kinds of market models
    * Discrete time models
        * Single period models
        * Multi-period models
    * Continuous time models

Pros/Cons of discrete time models
    * Pros: All important concepts with less sophisticated mathematics
    * Cons: No closed form solutions ... have to resort to numerical calculations

Focus of this course: Discrete time multi-period models

Caveat: Very, very few continuous time concepts covered, e.g. the Black-Scholes formula

Financial Economics vs Financial Engineering
---------------------------------------------

Financial Economics: Use equilibrium arguments to
    * Price equities, bonds and other assets
    * Set interest rates

Financial Engineering: Assume prices of equities and interest rates given
    * Price derivatives on equities, bonds, interest rates, etc., using the no-arbitrage condition

Non even close to being a complete separation
    * For example, Capital Asset Pricing Model of interest to both

Central problems of FE
------------------------
Security pricing 
    * Primary securities: stocks and bonds ...  financial economics
    * Derivative securities: forwards, swaps, futures, options, on the underlying securities

Portfolio selection: choose a trading strategy to maximize the utility of consumption and final wealth
    * Intimately related to security pricing
    * Single-period models: Markowitz portfolio selection
    * Real options, e.g. options on gas pipelines, oil leases, mines

Risk management: understand the risks inherent in a portfolio
    * Tail risk: probability of large losses
    * Value-at-risk and condition value at-risk
    * Starting to become important for portfolio selection as well

Led to interesting applied math/operations research problems
